# Video3.0

Video3.0 is video platform with which you can access videos from YouTube, Odysee, IPFS and Popcorn Time. Currently this project has few backend functions, but with time those functions will fully transition to decentralized services, making Video3.0 Web3.0 site.

To run open two terminals and run to start backend:
```
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```
and to start frontend:
```
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

In addition to starting frontend and backend, if you want full features of site like IPFS, you will need to run IPFS node on your localhost, or change IPFS endpoint, if you use public it will work but bcs of speed it will be mostly unusable.
